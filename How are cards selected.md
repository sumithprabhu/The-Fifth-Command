# 🃏 Agent Arena — Card Requirement Formula & Example

## ⚙️ Formula

Let:
- **x** = number of teams (or agents)

Then the required cards for a full game setup are:

Sentinels = x / 2
Attackers = x × 2
Defenders = x × 2
Strategists = x
Total Cards = (x / 2) + (x × 2) + (x × 2) + x


---

## 🧩 Example — For 5 Teams

x = 5
Sentinels = 5 / 2 = 2.5 ≈ 3 cards
Attackers = 5 × 2 = 10 cards
Defenders = 5 × 2 = 10 cards
Strategists = 5 cards


✅ **Total Cards = 3 + 10 + 10 + 5 = 28 cards**
