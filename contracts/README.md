## About

The Fifth Command is a real-time strategic auction card game where 5 agents compete to build the strongest team and claim the pot. Strategic bidding, team composition, and winner takes all.

Players join games by paying an entry fee and receive starting chips. Throughout multiple rounds, cards are auctioned off, and players bid strategically to acquire the best cards for their team. The player with the strongest team composition at the end wins the entire pot.
